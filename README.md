# 🧭 Data-to-Insight Narrative Builder

## Overview
This toolkit provides a repeatable framework for turning raw data into an evidence-based story or argument.  
It’s designed for analysts, designers, and communicators who need to explain *why data matters* — not just what it says.

The pattern blends data journalism, rhetorical structure, and systems thinking to build a case from facts → insight → action.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
Transform datasets or metrics into a structured argument that supports clear decision-making.  
This can be used for:
- Infographics or dashboards with a narrative spine  
- Stakeholder reports that justify recommendations  
- Public or internal data stories that build understanding

## 🧩 Inputs

| Input | Description | Example |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Topic or Dataset** | The dataset or area you’re explaining | *Employee resilience, healthcare spend, engagement metrics* |
| **Intended Audience** | Who needs to understand or act on this | *Executives, HR, policymakers, employees* |
| **Desired Outcome** | What decision or shift in understanding you want | *“Convince HR that preemptive care lowers spend”* |

## 🧠 Core Pattern: The Data Journalism Arc

| Phase | Purpose | Key Questions |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **1. Data** | Establish the facts | What do we actually have? Where did it come from? |
| **2. Information** | Organize and clarify | What patterns or relationships appear? |
| **3. Insight** | Interpret meaning | What does this suggest or reveal? Why does it matter? |
| **4. Outcome** | Show consequence | What changed, or could change, because of this? |
| **5. Action** | Make the case | What should happen next? What’s the takeaway? |

## 📚 Supporting Frameworks

### 1. Toulmin Model (Argument Map)
| Component | Function | Example |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Claim** | Main conclusion | “Resilience reduces healthcare spend.” |
| **Data** | Supporting evidence | Usage data, engagement metrics |
| **Warrant** | Reasoning that links data to claim | Reflection → behavior → health improvement |
| **Backing** | Further support | Psychometric tools, studies |
| **Qualifier** | Scope or confidence | “Early data suggests…” |
| **Rebuttal** | Limitations | “Sample size of 20 users.” |

### 2. Evidence Ladder
> **Data → Patterns → Insights → Outcomes → Evidence → Impact**

Used in research and evaluation to show how raw data compounds into verified impact.

---

### 3. Case-Building Arc
> **Situation → Problem → Evidence → Insight → Implication → Recommendation**

Common in consulting decks and policy briefs.

## ⚙️ Outputs
When applied, the project should produce:
- A structured **data narrative** (report, infographic, or storyboard)  
- A clear **claim or argument** supported by data  
- A **chain of evidence** (charts, tables, or user metrics)  
- A **call to action** (policy, product, or behavior recommendation)

---

## 💬 Example Prompt
> “Using the Data-to-Insight Narrative Builder, create a concise argument showing how employee resilience scores relate to healthcare savings. Start with data (session counts and average scores), then show patterns, interpret insights, describe outcomes, and end with a call to action. Use clear section headers and keep the flow persuasive but evidence-based.”
